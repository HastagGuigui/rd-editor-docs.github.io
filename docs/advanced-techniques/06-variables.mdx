# Variables

There are two types of variables: **read-only** and **editable**. The value of read-only variables cannot be changed manually, while they can be changed  in editable variables.

## Editable Variables

There are currently 3 types of editable variables: **integers** (i), **floats** (f), and **booleans** (b). 10 of each variable are currently accessible. The names of variables cannot be changed, only their values.

- Integers are named i0, i1, ... i9.
    - Can take any integer value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
- Floats are named f0, f1, ... f9.
- Booleans are named b0, b1, ... b9.
    - Either `true` or `false`.

The variable `buttonPressCount` acts like an integer (and can be modified accordingly), but is additionally incremented whenever the player presses.

## Read-only variables

These are special variables that provide some information about the current level or state of the game. The value of these variables cannot be modified, they can only be read.

|     Variable Name       |                 Definition                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `bpm`                   | The currently set bpm                      |
| `barNumber`             | The current bar number                     |
| `numEarlyHits`          | The current number of early hits           |
| `numLateHits`           | The current number of late hits            |
| `numPerfectHits`        | The current number of perfect hits         |
| `numMisses`             | The current number of misses (without mistake weighting) |
| `numMistakes`           | The current number of mistakes (with mistake weighting)  |
| `XPress`  (X is a key)  | `true` immediately when X is pressed, `false` otherwise  |
| `XRelease`              | `true` immediately when X is released, `false` otherwise |
| `XIsPressed`            | `true` while X is being held down, `false` otherwise     |

List of allowed keys: `p1`, `p2`, `anyPlayer`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`.

## Using variables

Variables can be used in 3 locations:
- *Call Custom Method*, in an expression
- *Floating Text*/*Dialogue*/*Status Sign*
- [Conditionals](03-conditionals.mdx)

### Call Custom Method

Variables can be read or modified in the Custom Method Name field. This can be combined with tags and conditionals to allow programmatic usage of variables.

This supports the operators `++`, `--`, and `=`.

Examples: `i1++`, `i2 = 4`

### Floating Text/Dialogue Status Sign

Variables can be displayed in these events using interpolation. Simply surround the expression with braces.

Examples: `I have {i1} apples`, `We have {i1 + i2} pears`


### Conditionals

Variables can be read in the Expression field of a condition. These can be combined with operators `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`. 

Examples: `i1 == 1`, `i2 > i3`


## Operators
In addition to the comparison operators, there are also the mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` (modulo).
